Where below, we see that the highest catogory is family. At first glance Android might seem to be more of a family platform, however taking a second look at the family category we see that this might not be the case. As a variety of games apps are categorized as family. This highlights the issue with the google play categorizations, and the lack of clearly defined delineations.  \n",

    "We can see that there are some similarities between iOS data and Google Play Store data, however there are a much higher number of gaming apps on Android than there are on iOS. Outside of this difference, both platforms show that communication, social media, and books and reference are lucrative categories to get into, as they draw the largest number of users. "

    "This initial project began with a desire to develop a successful mobile app. Before embarking on this endeavor we begin by determining the most profitable apps, with a focus on users leading to profitability. Data sets were obtained from both Apple's App store and google's Google play store to get a wide enough understanding on what genres are popular irrespective of platform. The focus was on free apps, as paid apps bring a factor of quality into the equation that we were not looking to analyse for this project. To minimize the risk of developing an unsuccessful app we looked to focus on 3 seperate steps.\n",

    "1. Build minimal version of an android app for Google Play\n",
    "2. Determine reception, if positive develop further.\n",
    "3. If app is profitable after 6 months develop an app for iOS and add to the App Store. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step began with an exraction of the data and a cleaning of the data. The data was cleaned by removing missing or incorrect indeces, removing duplicate entries seen within the data, removing as many non - english apps as possible, and removing paid apps. All of this was done on both the iOS data set and android data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "An analysis was then performed. It was determined that irrespective of the two platforms, communication, social media, and books/reference were 3 of the most popular categories. Outliers included gaming apps, which was significantly prevalent on the Google Play store. Due to communication and social media apps being highly competitive currently, an app focusing on books/reading has a high chance of being successful, with a focus on religion proving to be the most popular within this category. Features such as daily quotes, progress tracking, and more would need to be added to said app in order to remain competitive. With this data based approach, the likelihood of developing a successful app has increased.  "
